Media - raise to overweight

Favourable entry point

Media has been is a big laggard following a six-month period of sustained
underperformance and hit very oversold levels on our CTIs in mid-November. Although
Media is a bit more domestic than Tech both are “quality” cyclicals and typically trade
fairly in line with one another. However, the relative is now back at 2009 lows.

Optionality on European consumer

We are bearish on the outlook for the UK consumer but consumer confidence has been
steadily rising in the Eurozone since 2012 and the sector has tracked this measure very
closely. We note however that the two have disconnected recently. We think Media is
more likely to catch up then confidence fall given economists’ fairly positive view on
Eurozone growth next year, and the potential for upside surprises to US growth.

Media historically outperforms when PMIs and inflation rising
The average return for Media when PMls and inflation are both rising is 0.6% relative
but the sector has underperformed by 2% month to date. A stronger dollar is also a
positive historically for Media given that many large caps within the sector, notably
agencies, are large dollar earners. But again, the two have disconnected recently.
Valuations now at a small discount to the market
Media has de-rated by nearly four PE points (from 19.7 to 16) since the April 2015 highs
and the sector now trades on a 5% discount to its average vs the market. We think the
improving global growth backdrop will support earnings and should mean the sector can
re-rate.
