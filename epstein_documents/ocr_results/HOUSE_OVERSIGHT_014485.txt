As we outline below, we think it is just a matter of timing. The political certainty created
by the swift election of Theresa May plus the Bank of England’s interventions have
delayed, rather than resolved, the underlying uncertainties caused by the vote.

2017: Falling growth, negotiations and a consumer squeeze
We think there are clear warning signs that conditions are deteriorating, uncertainty is
set to return and a consumer squeeze is coming for the UK.

Falling growth to compound deficit problems

Real gdp is only expected to fall 0.1% in 2016 vs the March forecast. But the UK Office
of Budgetary Responsibility expects growth to slip by 0.8% next year (2.2% to 1.4%) and
0.4% on 2018 (2.1% to 1.7%) vs March. A notable slice of this is can be attributed to the
OBR’s estimate that Brexit added £59bn to UK borrowing to 2022, or nearly £200mn a
week. These numbers include Phillip Hammond’s sensible but small measures. Our UK
economist is more pessimistic forecasting 0.9% in 2017 and 0.7% in 2018. Even if we
split the two, that represents a 50% decline in expected 2017 gdp and 40% decline in
2018. The OBR also expects public sector net debt to hit its highest level since 1964-65
in 2017-18 at a time when the UK already relies on “the kindness of strangers” to
finance its growing twin deficit.
