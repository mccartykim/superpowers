Underweight Retail

In addition to Brexit concerns, we also see a number of fundamental reasons to reiterate
out underperform on Retail.

Chart 66: Stiff competition means retail margins are structural declining

Structural margin pressures: Aside from Brexit, retailers face declining returns as
online disruptors and discounters drive up competition. EBITDA margins have fallen
from 8% in 2010 to close to 7% in 2016 and RoE has declined by nearly 3% since
2004. We think this structural trend has further to run.

Valuations are also unattractive. Retail remains on a significant premium to the
market on absolute terms (17.3x 2017 PE vs 14.2x) and is expensive versus its own
history at 20% above its 10y relative average on PE and 92%ile on PBV, while it has
the second lowest dividend in the market (2.9%). Even if you strip H&M and Inditex
the sector is towards the higher range of its post-GFC range.

UK supermarkets have had their relief rally. Despite challenges facing UK food
retailers, Tesco has rallied 25% and Morrison’s 15% since Brexit as retail spending
has held up and the short base grew massively immediately following the UK-EU
vote. Yet as Xavier Le Mene notes, this has largely been because they have gained
market share from Asda and investors have bought into their new management
plans. However, Xavier see limited upside potential for either next year and there is
a risk that Asda starts to recoup lost ground under its new management too.
