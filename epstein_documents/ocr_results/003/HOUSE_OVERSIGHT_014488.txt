Given all of the above, we reiterate our preference for avoiding sectors with a high
proportion of domestic UK companies. To our mind, these companies face a lose-lose

trade-off of maintaining margins by passing on higher costs at the expense of volumes,
or face margin pressure by absorbing these costs in order to sustain current volumes in

our view. This could be further compounded if our Oil Strategists’ forecasts are right
and Brent averages ~S60/bb following an OPEC cut.

But how much fs in the price?
The pushback to our view is that the forecasted deterioration in growth hasn't really
materialised and investors are already pricing it in a lot of bad news. For instance,

Easyjet is down nearly 35% and investors are still underweight the UK in the FMS. While
this is the case for certain stocks, at a sector level investors appear to have squared off

their underweights in Retail/ Travel according to the FMS. Both sectors also back near
pre-Brexit levels relative to the market (albeit Travel reflects the recent oil price

weakness).
