Underweight Travel & Leisure

- Airlines in structural decline: our European Airlines analyst thinks overcapacity
(networks set to grow 7% yoy to 2020) and competition from low cost/ ME carriers
is driving prices and passenger yields lower across the board.

- Negatively correlated to Oil: the sector is negatively correlated to the Oil price
and despite recent weakness, our Commodity Strategist expects OPEC to cut by
500k b/d or 1 million b/d. Should OPEC cut with firm quotas and a tight control
mechanism, they see WTI prices averaging $59/bbl.

* Watch UK consumer confidence closely: the combined effect of the challenges
we identified earlier starting to mount for the UK consumer and the drop in the
value of the pound could reduce demand for and expenditure on overseas holidays.
This would weigh on the travel operator part of the sector. If the bulk of sterling
move is over the boost for dollar earnings like Compass will also likely fade.

¢ Peak returns: unlike Retail, T&L margins (98%ile since 2004) and RoEs (85%ile) are
close to all-time highs. We think returns may well have peaked therefore given the
backdrop of rising oil, weakening consumer confidence in the UK and structural
overcapacity in airlines. This is reflected in the fact that PBV are on 2.8x for the
sector, which is top quintile for the sector since 2004.
