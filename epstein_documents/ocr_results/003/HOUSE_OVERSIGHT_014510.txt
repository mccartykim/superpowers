Tribute to a V.I. leader

The community paid tribute to the late Mulo Alwani
on Friday with a memorial service gathering at

the Mark C. Marin Center at Antilles School on St.
Thomas. Alwani, the president of the India Associa-
tion of the Virgin Islands and a longtime community
leader, died on Nov. 19 in Miami after a bout with
cancer. He was 79.

Alwani, the former owner of Artistic Jewelers in
Charlotte Amalie, had served on the Schneider
Medical Center governing board and was a leader in
the Rotary and the Masonic Lodge. He was remem-
bered as the “godfather of the Indian community”
as well as a friend and a mentor to many.
