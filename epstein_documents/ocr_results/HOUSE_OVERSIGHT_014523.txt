The US team is out with their 2017 Year Ahead this morning (link) running through ALL sub-sectors with each analysts
top pick into the new year.

Top Picks — ACAD, AGN, ANTM, CELG, CVS, DHR, EW, EVHC, RARE, REGN, WBA

Washington DC Backdrop

Given the clean sweep by the GOP & uncertainty around the ACA, key attention is paid by Andy Bressler to a review of
the various scenarios that could play out early next year. With a repeal likely to happen well before a replace
(essentially via the Budget Reconciliation process in Jan/Feb), Andy notes this is likely to include a repeal of both
health insurance exchange subsidies & a phase-down of Medicaid expansion funding (albeit with a two or three year
transition period).

He also expects a repeal of many of the larger HC related taxes in the ACA, including the HIX ($14.3bn in 2018),
Medtech Tax (2.3%), pharma industry tax ($4.1bn in 2018) & Cadillac tax (effective 2020).

As for the views by analysts...
Biotech (+) — believe sector will outperform largely as pricing risk has diminished (although will remain in pockets) but
pipelines/growth remains. Ying’s top picks are CELG & REGN; Tazeen’s top picks are ACAD & RARE.

Spec Pharma (-) — headwinds remain w/ Sumant’s top pick AGN given lower risk to reimbursement pressures & an
underappreciated pipeline. Leverage & CF remain the key focus for investors.

Tools/Animal Health (=) — Derik notes more “headline” than “real” risks from policy which will create opportunities for a
group growing MSD, although valuations remain above peers. DHR (US 1 name) top pick, also A, ZTS in Animal
Health, BDX in Diagnostics & CTLT in Services.

Medtech (=) — Hopkins’ expects a mixed bag in 2017 w/ stocks trading close to 5yr valuation lows; EW top pick given
best growth / purest innovation story.
