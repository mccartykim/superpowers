The 2016 Election: Tax Changes Expected

INTRODUCTION

The election of Donald Trump as President is expected to lead to significant tax law changes. The tax changes
may come in two parts: (1) from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and its related taxes and (2)
from comprehensive tax reform. Since Republicans will also have majorities! in both the House and Senate, it is
anticipated that such changes could be undertaken without the need for bipartisan support. It is likely that the
Affordable Care Act, and its taxes, could be repealed in early 2017 and result in an immediate tax cut for dividends,
capital gains and high-income earners. It is more time consuming to enact comprehensive tax reform and such

efforts may not result in a tax bill until mid-

1 |n the House of Representatives, a simple majority is sufficient to pass legislation. It is more complicated in the Senate,
where 60 votes (a super majority) are required to avoid a filibuster. Republicans have a simple majority, but not a super
majority, in the Senate. However, there is a budget procedure known as Reconciliation, which allows certain legislation to
be passed without filibuster. Accordingly, it would appear that Republicans could pass tax legislation in the Senate with just
a simple majority.
