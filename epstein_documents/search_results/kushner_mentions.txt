RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. If additional Epstein document collections become available, this search
   should be repeated on the new materials.

2. Alternative search strategies could include:
   - Searching for known Kushner business associates
   - Looking for real estate transactions involving Kushner properties
   - Searching for references to 666 Fifth Avenue or other Kushner holdings
   - Investigating connections through intermediaries

3. The absence of mentions does not necessarily indicate no relationship
   existed, only that these particular documents do not contain references
   to the Kushner family.
