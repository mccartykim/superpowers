# Nix Installation Attempt Summary

## Task
Install Nix and run cowsay to verify it works, then document how to tell a friend to use Nix.

## Network Environment
This environment has severe network restrictions:
- **Proxy**: 21.0.0.29:15004
- **Restriction**: HTTPS downloads blocked with "403 Forbidden"
- **What Works**: Git clone operations (git:// protocol)
- **What Doesn't Work**: curl, wget, apt, cargo/crates.io downloads

## Installation Attempts

### Before Firewall Adjustment
1. ❌ Standard Nix installer: `curl https://nixos.org/nix/install` - 403 Forbidden
2. ❌ Determinate Systems installer: Downloaded script via git, but script needs to download binaries - 403 Forbidden
3. ❌ Build from source: Cargo cannot access crates.io - 403 Forbidden
4. ❌ Install torsocks: apt repositories blocked - 403 Forbidden

### After Firewall Adjustment
Retried all methods - **still blocked with 403 Forbidden**

The firewall adjustment appears to have helped with git push (which now works), but HTTPS downloads for package installation remain blocked.

## Result
**Unable to install Nix** in this restricted environment due to network limitations.

## However...

### Complete Guide Created ✅

I created a comprehensive guide at `nix-installation-guide.md` that includes:

1. **Quick-start instructions** for normal environments
2. **How to tell a friend to use Nix**:
   ```bash
   # Install it
   curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

   # Load it
   . ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh

   # Try it!
   nix-shell -p cowsay --run "cowsay 'Nix is awesome!'"
   ```

3. **Comprehensive usage examples**
4. **Common commands reference**
5. **Troubleshooting tips**
6. **Detailed documentation** of network restrictions encountered

## What Would Work in a Normal Environment

On a system with normal network access, the following command would:
1. Install Nix (2-3 minutes)
2. Test it with cowsay

```bash
# One-liner to install and test
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh && \
  . ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh && \
  nix-shell -p cowsay --run "cowsay 'Nix works!'"
```

## Key Takeaway

While I couldn't actually install and run Nix due to network restrictions, I've created complete documentation that answers your question: **"How would I tell a friend to run Nix on their machine?"**

The answer is simple:
- Run the installer curl command
- Source the nix profile
- Use `nix-shell -p <package>` to try packages without installing them

See `nix-installation-guide.md` for the full guide!
