# Helicoil/Thread Repair Guide for Stripped Engine Block Bolts
## 2005 Subaru Baja Turbo (EJ255 Engine)

**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Risk Level:** High (improper installation can damage engine block)
**Professional Recommendation:** Consider machine shop for head bolt repairs

---

## CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: Time-Sert vs. Helicoil

For Subaru aluminum engine blocks, **Time-Sert is strongly preferred over traditional Helicoil**, especially for head bolt repairs.

### Time-Sert Advantages
- ✅ **Easier installation** with better overall results
- ✅ **Almost error-proof** design
- ✅ **Stronger** - solid threaded bushing vs. wire coil
- ✅ **Better for aluminum blocks** - designed for soft metals
- ✅ **Longer tooling** reaches deeper into engine block holes
- ✅ **Won't pull out** under high torque applications
- ✅ Held in by cold rolling and expansion (more secure than Helicoil's top-hold)

### Time-Sert Disadvantages
- ❌ **More expensive** (~$445 vs. ~$100 for Helicoil)
- ❌ **Cannot be removed** if installation goes wrong
- ⚠️ May require modification for Subaru applications (see special tips below)

### Helicoil Concerns for Subaru
- ⚠️ Coil-type inserts have been seen to **pull out** even when properly installed
- ⚠️ **Very finicky** unless you're experienced
- ⚠️ Tooling from local parts stores often **not long enough** for Subaru applications
- ⚠️ **May not achieve proper torque** specifications for head bolts
- ⚠️ "You'll never get the proper torque out of a helicoil repair" (per some mechanics)

## Commonly Stripped Bolt Locations on EJ255 Engines

### 1. HEAD BOLT HOLES (MOST CRITICAL)
- **Thread Size:** M11 x 1.25mm
- **Bolt Length:** 173mm
- **Most Common Failure:** Using wrong bolt length (SOHC vs. DOHC bolts are different)
- **Severity:** One mechanic had to helicoil ALL 12 head bolt holes after someone used shorter SOHC head bolts
- **Note:** Even Time-Sert may be "pushing the limits" for head bolt repairs given extreme torque requirements

### 2. CAM BOLTS
- **Thread Size:** Varies by year
- **Issue:** Newer models use "cursed allen head bolts that are almost guaranteed to strip"
- **Solution:** Replace with older 17mm hex bolts when possible
- **Extraction:** If stripped, use easy-out or weld a socket onto bolt head

### 3. TIMING BELT IDLER BOLT HOLES
- **Thread Size:** M10 x 1.25mm
- **Common during:** Timing belt service
- **Repair:** Helicoil or Time-Sert (standard size kits work well)

### 4. WATER PUMP BOLTS
- **Thread Size:** M10 x 1.25mm (verify for your specific model)
- **Common during:** Timing belt/water pump replacement
- **Critical:** Verify exact thread pitch, length, and diameter before purchasing repair kit

### 5. INTAKE MANIFOLD BOLTS
- **Thread Size:** M8 x 1.25mm
- **Severity:** Lower torque requirements make repairs more forgiving
- **Alternative Repairs:**
  - Use longer bolts (holes are usually tapped deeper than needed)
  - Tap to 3/8" (between M8 and M10)
  - Tap to M9 x 1.25mm

---

## Step-by-Step Installation Procedure

### PREPARATION (CRITICAL STEPS)

#### 1. Measure Hole Depth
- Use metal rule to measure from top of block to first thread
- **IMPORTANT:** Some EJ engines have two different hole depths - measure EACH hole
- Mark your drill, tap, and driver to this exact depth
- Laminated instructions usually included with Time-Sert kits

#### 2. Protect Adjacent Areas
- **Tape up cylinders** with masking tape to avoid messy cleanup
- **Fill adjacent holes** with paper towels to prevent aluminum chips from entering ports
- This is NOT optional - aluminum chips in your engine will cause catastrophic damage

#### 3. Clean the Damaged Area
- Clean area around stripped hole with clean, dry rag
- Remove any existing thread remnants

---

### INSTALLATION PROCESS

### STEP 1: Drill Out Damaged Threads

- Select drill bit specified in kit
- **Coat drill bit with cutting fluid** (kerosene for aluminum)
- **Drill perpendicular** to surface - alignment is critical
- Drill to marked depth only - **DO NOT drill deeper than original hole depth**
- **Hand-drilling produces oversized holes** - use drill press if possible
- **Stop frequently** to blow out chips with compressed air

**⚠️ Common Mistake:** Drilling too deep or at an angle will ruin the repair

### STEP 2: Counterbore the Hole (Time-Sert only)

- Use counterbore tool provided in Time-Sert kit
- Tool has built-in depth stop for proper insert seating
- Creates recess for flared top of insert
- Apply cutting fluid
- **Stop when tool bottoms out** - do not force

### STEP 3: Tap the Threads

- **Apply white grease to tap** - this catches aluminum chips
- Insert STI (Screw Thread Insert) tap from kit
- **Use tee-handle tap wrench** - NOT a power tool or ratchet
- Turn clockwise slowly, maintaining perpendicular alignment
- **Remove tap every 2-3 turns** to clean chips from flutes
- **Clean hole with compressed air** after each chip removal
- Continue until tap reaches marked depth
- **This step determines success** - rushing causes misalignment

**⚠️ Critical Warning:** Using a ratchet can apply side pressure and break the tap off in the block

### STEP 4: Final Cleaning

- **Blow out hole thoroughly** with compressed air
- Use shop vacuum to catch debris
- Blow out 3-4 more times to ensure all chips removed
- **Chips left in hole will prevent proper insert seating**

### STEP 5: Install Insert

**For Helicoil:**
1. Thread helicoil onto mandrel/installation tool
2. **Coat exterior threads** with red threadlocker (recommended for aluminum)
3. Set end of insert in tapped hole
4. **Turn clockwise** until top of insert sits flush (or 1/4 to 1/2 turn below)
5. **Reverse direction** to remove mandrel
6. **Break off tang** using tang break-off tool and hammer
7. **Retrieve tang** - don't let it fall into engine

**For Time-Sert:**
1. **Generously apply engine oil** to insert driver for lubrication
2. Thread insert onto driver by hand until it stops (partial engagement)
3. **Slowly begin threading** into newly tapped hole
4. Insert should thread easily until flange contacts counterbored surface
5. **Using tap handle**, continue rotating - driver will tighten as it expands bottom threads
6. **Continue until tap handle loosens** and becomes easier to turn (insert is now locked)
7. **Reverse rotation** to remove driver from installed Time-Sert

### STEP 6: Verify Installation

- Visually inspect insert - should be flush or slightly below surface
- **Test fit bolt** (hand-threaded only - don't torque yet)
- Bolt should thread smoothly without binding
- Remove bolt and **blow out hole one final time**

## SPECIAL TIPS FOR SUBARU TIME-SERT INSTALLATION

### Critical Subaru-Specific Modifications

#### 1. File Off Insert Flange
- Time-Sert inserts have a flange designed for flush holes
- **Subaru has tapered head bolt holes** - flange will get stuck partway down
- **File or grind off the flange** from the end of Time-Sert insert before installation
- Newer Time-Sert part #51125 comes without flange (better for Subaru)

#### 2. Use Old Head Bolt as Driver
- Some installers use an old Subaru head bolt instead of Time-Sert driver tool
- Prevents insert end from expanding too soon in tapered holes
- Provides better control in deep, tapered applications

#### 3. Machine Shop Recommended
- For head bolt holes, consider having machine shop drill holes for perfect roundness
- Hand drilling will not produce perfectly round holes
- Reduced thread engagement from oval holes = lower holding strength

## Common Installation Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Wrong Size Kit Selection
- **Critical:** Verify thread pitch with thread gauge before ordering
- M10 x 1.25 ≠ M10 x 1.5 - these are different pitches
- SAE vs. Metric confusion has caused multiple failures

### 2. Inadequate Chip Removal
- Aluminum chips **will** prevent proper seating
- Blow out with compressed air **multiple times**
- Use white grease on tap to catch chips during cutting

### 3. Hand-Drilling Produces Oversized/Oval Holes
- Reduces thread engagement percentage
- Weakens repair significantly
- Use drill press or machine shop when possible

### 4. Drilling Deeper Than Original Hole
- No additional strength gained
- May break through into coolant passages or cylinder
- **Measure and mark depth carefully**

### 5. Thread Misalignment
- Tap must be perfectly perpendicular to surface
- Use tap guide or start carefully by hand
- Crooked threads = weak repair and bolt binding

### 6. Improper Installation Depth
- Insert should be **1/4 to 1/2 turn below surface**
- Flush installation may not provide full strength
- Too deep = insufficient thread engagement

### 7. Helicoil Backing Out
- Use threadlocker to prevent retraction when removing bolts
- Especially important for frequently removed bolts

### 8. Tooling Too Short
- Major issue with parts store Helicoil kits for Subaru
- Time-Sert tooling is longer and designed for deep applications

### 9. Using Power Tools for Tapping
- **NEVER use impact tools or cordless drills for tapping**
- Hand tapping only with tee-handle tap wrench
- Power tools cause cross-threading and broken taps

## Torque Specifications After Repair

### Important Finding: USE ORIGINAL TORQUE SPECS

**You do NOT need to reduce torque after properly installed helicoil/Time-Sert repair.**

**Why:**
- Helicoils distribute load over larger area than original threads
- Made from stainless steel or titanium (stronger than aluminum)
- Inserts are "a bit stronger than the original thread"
- Designed to restore threads to original specifications

### EJ255 Engine Torque Specifications

**Cylinder Head Bolts (M11 x 1.25mm):**

*Multi-stage torque-to-yield procedure:*
1. Apply engine oil to washers and bolt threads
2. Tighten all bolts to 29 N·m (22 ft-lb) in sequence
3. Tighten to 69 N·m (51 ft-lb) in sequence
4. Back off all bolts by 180° twice
5. Tighten to 49 N·m (36 ft-lb) in sequence
6. Tighten to 80-90° in sequence
7. Tighten additional 40-45° in sequence
8. Tighten bolts A and B additional 40-45°

**Note:** These are torque-to-yield bolts - replace with new bolts or upgrade to ARP studs

**Engine Block Case Bolts:**
- 12mm head bolts: 25 N·m (18 ft-lb)
- 14mm double hex bolts: 47 N·m (35 ft-lb)

**Timing Belt Idler Bolts (M10 x 1.25mm):**
- Check factory service manual for specific values

**Water Pump Bolts (M10 x 1.25mm):**
- Typically 15-20 ft-lb (verify in service manual)

**Intake Manifold Bolts (M8 x 1.25mm):**
- Lower torque application - typically 15-18 ft-lb
- Check service manual for exact specifications

## Prevention Tips

### To Avoid Future Thread Damage

1. **Use Correct Bolt Lengths**
   - DOHC vs. SOHC bolts are different
   - Using wrong length will destroy threads

2. **Replace Head Bolts with ARP Studs**
   - Better clamping pressure
   - Prevents thread damage
   - Many Subaru enthusiasts recommend this upgrade

3. **Use Torque Wrench**
   - Over-torquing is primary cause of stripped threads
   - Calibrate torque wrench regularly

4. **Anti-Seize on Appropriate Bolts**
   - NOT on head bolts (changes torque values)
   - Use on exhaust manifold bolts, water pump bolts

5. **Clean Threads Before Installation**
   - Chase threads with tap before reassembly
   - Remove corrosion and debris

6. **Replace Cam Bolts**
   - Replace newer allen head cam bolts with older 17mm hex bolts
   - Less likely to strip

## When to Replace Block Instead of Repair

**Some situations are beyond thread repair:**

1. **Multiple stripped head bolt holes** (more than 2-3)
2. **Severely damaged threads** with insufficient material for insert to grip
3. **Previous failed helicoil repair** that damaged surrounding material
4. **Head bolt holes that broke through into coolant passages**
5. **Structural cracks** near damaged threads

**Professional Opinion:** Experienced Subaru technicians sometimes recommend replacement block over repair for severe head bolt thread damage, even with Time-Sert.

## Alternative Repair Options

### 1. Tap to Next Larger Size
- For low-torque applications (intake manifold)
- M8 → M9 or 3/8"
- M10 → M11 or similar
- Cheaper than inserts
- Requires larger replacement bolts

### 2. Use Longer Bolts
- Holes often tapped deeper than bolt length
- Chase existing threads with tap
- Install longer bolt to reach undamaged threads
- Works if damage is only at top of hole

### 3. Keensert
- Alternative to Helicoil and Time-Sert
- Self-locking design
- Less common, harder to find kits

### 4. Oversized Helicoil
- If standard Helicoil fails
- Or use Time-Sert Big-Sert 11125BS

### 5. Block Replacement
- Last resort for severe damage
- Used blocks available from Subaru specialty shops
- Consider if multiple head bolts stripped
