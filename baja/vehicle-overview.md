## Common Issues & Maintenance Concerns

### Major Known Problems

#### 1. Head Gasket Failure
- Typically manifests around 100,000-150,000 miles
- Turbo EJ255 engines less prone than non-turbo EJ25
- **Prevention:** Use Subaru coolant additive during flushes
- **Repair Cost:** $2,000-$3,000+

#### 2. Turbocharger Failures
- Most turbos require replacement before 120,000 miles
- Reported failures as early as 71,000-85,000 miles
- **Replacement Cost:** $1,800-$2,500
- **Prevention:** Regular oil changes (3k miles), cool-down periods

#### 3. Transmission Issues (2004 Automatics)
- Grinding between 2nd and 3rd gears
- Programming issues - should be reflashed with 2005+ software
- Manual transmissions generally more reliable

#### 4. CV Joint Boot Deterioration
- Passenger side inboard CV joint boot commonly fails
- Heat from catalytic converter causes brittleness
- **Prevention:** Regular inspection

#### 5. Rust Issues
- Body panels and undercarriage prone to rust (salt-belt states)
- **Prevention:** Regular undercoating and rust treatment

### Maintenance Schedule

- **Oil Changes:** Every 3,000 miles (critical for turbo longevity)
- **Timing Belt:** 105,000 miles or 105 months - **INTERFERENCE ENGINE**
- **Water Pump:** Replace with timing belt
- **Coolant:** Use Subaru-specific coolant additive
- **Spark Plugs:** Follow turbo-specific intervals
- **Air Filter:** Regular replacement (important for turbo health)

### Recommended Preventive Measures
- Use premium fuel consistently
- Allow 30-60 second turbo cool-down before shutdown
- Monitor for boost leaks and intercooler issues
- Check oil level frequently (turbo engines can consume oil)

## Unique Features: Turbo vs Non-Turbo

### Performance Differences
- **Non-turbo:** 165-173 HP
- **Turbo:** 210 HP (45 HP advantage)
- Significantly more torque throughout RPM range

### Visual Distinctions (Turbo-Specific)
- Large functional hood scoop for intercooler
- Red-outlined "BAJA" badging
- Color-matched door handles and mirrors
- Short stubby roof antenna
- Turbo-specific 6-spoke 16-inch alloy wheels
