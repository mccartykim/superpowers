## REMOVAL PROCEDURE

### 1. PREPARATION (10 minutes)
- Disconnect negative battery cable
- Remove engine cover if equipped
- Remove air intake scoop/snorkel
- Remove belt cover if present
- **CRITICAL:** Take photos of EVAP hose routing behind pump (turbo models)

### 2. DRAIN FLUID - Optional but Recommended (5 minutes)
- Remove 4 bolts (10mm) on top of reservoir
- Lift cover and plate with fill screen
- Use turkey baster or fluid pump to extract fluid
- **OR** proceed with removal and catch spillage in drain pan

### 3. BELT REMOVAL (10 minutes)
- Locate belt tensioner
- Loosen alternator-to-A/C bracket bolt to allow alternator pivot
- Release belt tensioner using breaker bar
- Remove power steering belt
- Inspect belt for wear

### 4. DISCONNECT LINES (10 minutes)
- Place drain pan and rags under pump
- **High-pressure line:** Break 14mm banjo bolt loose (don't fully remove yet)
- Lightly retighten to minimize spillage
- Label return hose connection
- Disconnect electrical connector from pump

### 5. NAVIGATE EVAP HOSES - TURBO MODELS (15-30 minutes)

**⚠️ CRITICAL - MOST CHALLENGING PART:**
- Behind the pump are factory evaporative emissions hoses
- These hoses are **extremely brittle** and break easily
- **Take multiple photos before touching anything**
- Carefully move hoses to the side - **DO NOT FORCE**
- Mark or label any hoses you disconnect
- Replacement EVAP connectors/hoses are expensive

### 6. REMOVE PUMP BRACKET BOLTS (15 minutes)

**Bolt Locations:**
- **Front left bolt (12mm):** Between pump and alternator
- **Front right bolt (12mm):** On pump bracket
- **Hidden rear bolt (12mm):** Behind pump, bolts to engine block (hardest to access)
- **Black bracket bolt:** Holds power steering pump bracket in place

**Access Tips:**
- Use wobble sockets for rear bolt
- May need impact wrench for seized bolts
- Leave front bolts slightly loose to help align rear bolt

### 7. REMOVE PUMP FROM BRACKET (10 minutes)
- Remove 3 front pump-to-bracket bolts (12mm)
- Remove large bolt on backside running through pump to bracket
- Use small pry bar to release pump from bracket
- May need to tap metal bushing to free pump
- Once loose, disconnect white electrical connector
- Fully remove banjo bolt and pressure line
- Remove return hose
- Extract pump from engine bay

## INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

### 8. PREPARE NEW PUMP (10 minutes)
- Inspect new pump for shipping plugs (remove if present)
- Transfer electrical connector if necessary
- **Replace banjo bolt crush washers** (use NEW copper washers)
- Use small hammer to tap metal bushing into bracket if removed
- Compare old and new pumps to verify correct part

### 9. INSTALL PUMP TO BRACKET (15 minutes)
- Position pump into bracket
- Start **front lower right bolt** first (longest bolt)
- Start **front left bolt** a few threads
- Leave front bolts loose to help locate rear bolt
- Start **hidden rear bolt** to engine block
- **Alignment tip:** Keep front bolts loose until rear bolt engages threads
- Tighten all three pump-to-bracket bolts: **22-36 ft-lbs**
- Install large bolt through pump to bracket

### 10. RECONNECT LINES (10 minutes)
- Install new copper crush washers on banjo bolt
- Connect high-pressure line with banjo bolt
- **Torque banjo bolt to 28 ft-lbs** (use torque wrench - critical)
- Connect return hose to pump
- Secure return hose with new screw-type clamp (replace spring clamps)
- Reconnect electrical connector
- Verify all connections are secure

### 11. REINSTALL BRACKET AND ACCESSORIES (10 minutes)
- Reinstall black bracket bolts
- Torque bracket bolts: 16.9 ft-lbs
- Reinstall reservoir (if removed)
- **Carefully** reposition EVAP hoses to original locations (refer to photos)
- Verify no hoses are pinched or kinked

### 12. REINSTALL BELT (10 minutes)
- Route belt around pump pulley
- Route around other accessories (refer to belt routing diagram on radiator support)
- Release tensioner and slip belt onto final pulley
- Verify belt is seated properly on all pulleys
- Allow tensioner to apply pressure

### 13. RECONNECT BATTERY
- Reconnect negative battery cable
- Verify all tools removed from engine bay

## BLEEDING PROCEDURE

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:** Do NOT start the engine until the system is bled. Starting with air in the system can cause metal-to-metal contact damage to pump internals.

### 14. INITIAL BLEEDING - ENGINE OFF (20 minutes)

**Setup:**
- Jack up front of vehicle so wheels are off the ground
- Position drain pan under vehicle (fluid may drip)
- Remove reservoir cap

**Procedure:**
1. Fill reservoir to "FULL" mark with Dexron III ATF
2. **With engine OFF**, slowly turn steering wheel from full left to full right
3. Turn **lock-to-lock slowly** approximately 10 times
4. Pause 2-3 seconds at each lock position
5. Check fluid level after every 2-3 cycles
6. Refill as needed to maintain "FULL" level
7. Watch for bubbles in reservoir

**Important:**
- Turn wheel **SLOWLY** - rushing creates more bubbles
- Only go 75% to lock initially if resistance is felt
- If bubbles persist after 10 cycles, wait 30 minutes and repeat

### 15. BLEEDING WITH ENGINE RUNNING (15 minutes)

**Procedure:**
1. Start engine and let idle
2. Keep reservoir cap OFF
3. Verify fluid at "FULL" mark
4. Slowly turn steering wheel lock-to-lock 5-10 times
5. Hold at each lock for 2-3 seconds
6. Listen for whining/groaning (indicates air)
7. Check for bubbles in reservoir
8. Continue until bubbles stop appearing
9. Fluid level change should be within 3mm (0.12 in)

**Normal:** Bubbles should stop after approximately 3 lock-to-lock cycles with engine running

### 16. FINAL CHECK (10 minutes)
- Turn off engine
- Check fluid level (will be slightly lower with engine off)
- Top off to "FULL" mark if needed
- Install reservoir cap
- Lower vehicle to ground
- Start engine and turn wheel lock-to-lock on ground
- Listen for abnormal noises
- Check all connections for leaks
- Test drive and verify proper operation

## Common Issues and Pro Tips

### Most Common Problems

**1. Air in the System**
- **Symptom:** Whining, groaning, or moaning when turning
- **Cause:** O-ring failure at pump inlet, loose spring clamps on suction hose
- **Fix:** Replace O-ring (34427AA060), replace spring clamps with screw-type clamps
- **Prevention:** Bleed system thoroughly, check suction side for leaks

**2. Brittle EVAP Hoses (Turbo Models)**
- **Issue:** Emissions hoses behind pump are fragile and break easily
- **Cost:** EVAP connectors/hoses are expensive to replace
- **Prevention:** Take photos, work slowly, use penetrating oil on old connectors
- **Tip:** Have replacement hoses on hand before starting

**3. Seized Bracket Bolts**
- **Issue:** Rear bracket bolt to engine block commonly seizes
- **Solution:** Use impact wrench, penetrating oil, patience
- **Warning:** Cross-threading is common - start bolts by hand
- **Tip:** Clean threads with wire brush before reinstallation

**4. Incorrect Fluid**
- **Common Mistake:** Using power steering fluid instead of ATF
- **Correct:** Dexron II/III ATF only
- **Result:** Poor performance, potential pump damage

**5. O-Ring Failures**
- **Location:** Pump inlet from reservoir, pressure line connections
- **Symptoms:** Air ingestion, fluid leaks, whining
- **Solution:** Replace with OEM o-rings (aftermarket often don't fit properly)
- **Part Number:** 34427AA060 (reservoir connector o-ring)

### Pro Tips from Forums

**Before You Start:**
- Order new crush washers with pump
- Have extra ATF on hand (2 quarts recommended)
- Take extensive photos of EVAP hoses
- Inspect belts while you're in there - replace if cracked

**During Installation:**
- Replace spring clamps with screw-type clamps on all hoses
- Don't overtorque banjo bolt (28 ft-lbs max - "penalty for overtorque is trashed pump")
- Use wobble socket for hidden rear bolt
- Keep workspace organized - bolts are easy to lose

**Bleeding:**
- System is "self-bleeding by design" but manual bleeding still required
- Patience is key - rushing creates more bubbles
- If persistent air, check for suction-side leaks
- Leave vehicle sitting 30 minutes if bubbles won't clear
- Front wheels off ground during bleeding prevents strain

**Parts Selection:**
- OEM or quality remanufactured (A1 Cardone) recommended
- Cheap aftermarket pumps often fail quickly
- Verify pulley is included with replacement pump
- Some pumps don't include reservoir - check before ordering

### What NOT to Do

- Don't start engine with low fluid
- Don't turn wheel rapidly during bleeding
- Don't reuse copper crush washers
- Don't force EVAP hose connectors
- Don't skip bleeding procedure
- Don't use impact wrench on banjo bolt
- Don't mix different ATF types

- Check for leaks on suction side (reservoir to pump hose)
- Verify fluid level
- Inspect O-ring at pump inlet

### Hard Steering
- Air in system

- Defective new pump (rare but possible)

### Fluid Leaks
- **At banjo fitting:** Replace crush washers, check torque (28 ft-lbs)
