# 2005 Subaru Baja - Door Weatherstripping Guide

## Your Question: Glue or Tabs?

**Answer: Both - it depends on which weatherstrip section is coming loose.**

Subaru door weatherstripping uses DIFFERENT attachment methods depending on location:
- **Primary door seal (around door opening):** Mostly **clips/tabs** with some **adhesive sections**
- **Secondary door seal (on door edge):** Primarily **press-fit** with **optional adhesive**
- **Window/belt weatherstrip:** **Clips and screws**

**Most common issue:** The tabs/clips break or degrade over time, causing the weatherstrip to pop out when opening the door. This can usually be fixed by replacing the clips or adding adhesive as needed.

## Understanding Different Weatherstrips

Your Baja has several different weatherstrips around each door:

### 1. Primary Door Seal (Door Opening Weatherstrip)
- **Location:** Attached to the body around the door opening
- **Function:** Main water seal; creates flush fit with door sill, roof, and pillars
- **Attachment:** Combination of plastic clips and adhesive
- **Part Number:** Varies by location (A-pillar, B-pillar, rocker, header)

### 2. Secondary Door Seal (Door-Mounted Weatherstrip)
- **Location:** Attached to the door itself, around outer edge
- **Function:** Directs airflow away from door, reduces wind noise
- **Attachment:** Press-fit into groove with optional adhesive
- **Part Numbers:**
  - Left Front: 63511AE03A
  - Right Front: 63512AE03A (typical)

### 3. Window/Belt Weatherstrip
- **Location:** Along top of door where window seals
- **Function:** Seals window glass
- **Attachment:** Metal clips and screws
- **Less common issue**

## Attachment Methods Explained

### Method 1: Plastic Clips/Tabs (Most Common on Body-Mounted Seals)

**How It Works:**
- Plastic "T" shaped clips insert into holes in the body
- Weatherstrip has corresponding slots that slide onto the clips
- Creates secure but removable attachment

**Why They Fail:**
- Plastic becomes brittle with age and heat cycles
- Clips break during freezing rain or ice buildup
- Improper previous removal (yanking instead of sliding)

**Symptoms:**
- Weatherstrip pops out when door opens
- Visible gaps where seal should contact body
- Can see broken plastic clip pieces

**Factory Design:**
- Tabs are supposed to be sufficient - **no glue required for clipped sections**
- New weatherstrip comes with new clips included

### Method 2: Press-Fit into Channel (Common on Door-Mounted Seals)

**How It Works:**
- Weatherstrip has a molded bulb or barbed rib on one edge
- This edge presses into a U-shaped channel in the door frame
- Friction holds it in place

**Why It Fails:**
- Rubber loses elasticity over time
- Heat from summer sun causes shrinkage
- Channel fills with dirt or corrosion
- Original installation was marginal

**Symptoms:**
- Section of weatherstrip hangs loose
- Can easily pull weatherstrip out of channel
- No broken clips visible (because there aren't any)

**Factory Design:**
- Press-fit alone should hold - **no adhesive required originally**
- However, adhesive is recommended if seal keeps popping out

### Method 3: Adhesive (Used in Specific Locations)

**How It Works:**
- 3M weatherstrip adhesive bonds rubber to metal
- Creates permanent waterproof seal

**Where Subaru Uses It:**
- Corners where clips can't reach
- Ends of weatherstrip runs
- Some body-mounted seals without clip provisions
- Repairs where clips have failed

**Factory Design:**
- Some sections designed for adhesive from factory
- Other sections: adhesive is a **repair option** when clips fail

### Method 4: Screws (Rare on Weatherstrip, Common on Trim)

- Primarily used for rigid plastic trim pieces
- Window belt molding may use screws
- Not typical for flexible rubber weatherstrip

---

## Diagnosing Your Specific Issue

### Step 1: Identify Which Weatherstrip is Loose

**Open the door and look carefully:**

1. **Is it the seal ON the door itself?**
   - Runs along the outer edge of the door
   - Usually black rubber with a bulb edge
   - This is the **secondary seal** (part #63511AE03A / 63512AE03A)

2. **Is it the seal ON the body around the opening?**
   - Attached to the body, not the door
   - Door closes against it
   - This is the **primary seal** (body-mounted)

3. **Is it the window seal at the top of the door?**
   - Along the belt line where glass seals
   - Usually has rigid backing
   - This is the **window/belt weatherstrip**

### Step 2: Determine Attachment Method

**For body-mounted seals:**
- Look for plastic clip holes in the body sheet metal
- Check if weatherstrip has slots for clips
- **If yes:** Clip-type, may need new clips

**For door-mounted seals:**
- Look for a U-shaped channel in the door frame
- Check if weatherstrip has a bulb edge
- **If yes:** Press-fit type, may need adhesive

**Feel along the seal:**
- Sticky residue = was glued (adhesive needed)
- Clean metal = was clipped or press-fit

### Step 3: Check for Broken Components

**Clip-type seals:**
- Pull weatherstrip back gently
- Look for broken white or black plastic clips
- Check body holes - any clips still stuck in them?

**Press-fit seals:**
- Try to pull seal out of channel
- Does it come out easily? (Should take moderate force)
- Is the channel dirty, rusty, or deformed?

**Adhesive sections:**
- Is old adhesive dried and crumbly?
- Can you see separation gaps?
- Does seal flop around when door moves?

## Repair Procedures

### Repair Option 1: Replace Broken Clips (Clipped Weatherstrip)

**When to Use:** Weatherstrip is in good condition but clips are broken

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Time:** 30-60 minutes
**Cost:** $8-15 for clip set

**Tools Required:**
- Replacement clips (909120028 or aftermarket set)
- Flathead screwdriver or trim removal tool
- Needle-nose pliers

**Procedure:**

1. **Remove Weatherstrip Section**
   - Carefully pull weatherstrip to expose clips
   - To release from T-clip: stretch weatherstrip ONE WAY only
   - Slide weatherstrip off the clip side-to-side (don't yank down)

2. **Remove Old Clips**
   - Pull broken clips out of body holes with pliers
   - Clean any debris from holes with compressed air
   - Check that holes aren't damaged or enlarged

3. **Install New Clips**
   - Push new clips into body holes until they snap
   - Ensure clips are fully seated and don't wobble
   - Space clips evenly (typically 6-8" apart)

4. **Reinstall Weatherstrip**
   - Align weatherstrip slot with first clip
   - Press down and slide sideways onto clip
   - Work along the seal, installing each clip
   - Ensure seal sits flush and even

5. **Test**
   - Gently tug on weatherstrip - should not pull out
   - Open and close door several times
   - Check for even contact all around

**Tip:** Some aftermarket clip sets include clips for multiple applications. Choose the size that fits snugly in your body holes.

### Repair Option 2: Adhesive Installation (Press-Fit or Failed Clips)

**When to Use:**
- Press-fit seal keeps popping out
- Clips are broken and no replacements available
- Permanent repair desired

**Difficulty:** Moderate
**Time:** 2-3 hours (includes drying time)
**Cost:** $10-20 for adhesive

**Tools Required:**
- 3M Weatherstrip Adhesive (08008 Black or 08001 Yellow)
- Isopropyl alcohol (91% or higher)
- Clean rags
- Popsicle stick or spreader
- Masking tape
- Disposable gloves

**Procedure:**

1. **Remove Old Weatherstrip**
   - Carefully peel weatherstrip away from door/body
   - Work slowly to avoid tearing if you're reusing it
   - If replacing: order new seal first (takes 3-7 days)

2. **Surface Preparation** (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)
   - Remove ALL old adhesive residue
     - Use adhesive remover, Goo Gone, or WD-40
     - Scrape with plastic scraper (not metal - scratches paint)
   - Clean surface with isopropyl alcohol
     - Wipe until rag comes away clean
     - Let dry completely (10-15 minutes)
   - Clean weatherstrip rubber surface
     - Both old (if reusing) and new weatherstrips
     - Alcohol on both mating surfaces

3. **Adhesive Application** (3M Recommended Method)
   - Apply thin bead of adhesive to metal surface
   - Spread into thin film with popsicle stick
   - Let sit 2-5 minutes until tacky (very important)
   - Apply thin bead to weatherstrip rubber
   - Spread into thin film
   - Let sit 2-5 minutes until tacky

4. **Final Bond**
   - Apply one more thin bead to ONE surface
   - Align weatherstrip carefully (first time!)
   - Press firmly into place
   - Press along entire length with firm hand pressure
   - Use masking tape to hold in position while curing

5. **Curing**
   - Let cure for 24 hours before closing door firmly
   - Can close gently after 2-3 hours
   - Full strength after 72 hours

**CRITICAL TIPS:**
- **MORE IS NOT BETTER** - Thin films bond better than thick globs
- **Tacky is key** - Both surfaces must be tacky before final press
- **Clean surface** - Adhesive won't stick to dirt, oil, or old adhesive
- **Work in sections** - Don't try to glue entire seal at once

### Repair Option 3: Press-Fit Reinstallation (No Adhesive)

**When to Use:** Door-mounted seal has popped out but rubber is in good condition

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Time:** 15-30 minutes
**Cost:** Free

**Tools Required:**
- Rubber mallet or palm of your hand
- Putty knife or plastic trim tool
- Silicone spray lubricant (optional)

**Procedure:**

1. **Clean the Channel**
   - Remove any dirt, leaves, or debris from U-channel
   - Wipe with damp rag
   - Dry thoroughly

2. **Lubricate (Optional)**
   - Light spray of silicone on channel
   - Makes installation easier
   - Helps weatherstrip slide into place

3. **Install Weatherstrip**
   - Start at one end (usually top corner)
   - Align bulb edge with channel opening
   - Press bulb into channel with thumb
   - Work along in 6" sections
   - Use rubber mallet or palm to smack it in
   - Use putty knife to push stubborn sections

4. **Verify Installation**
   - Run finger along entire length
   - Weatherstrip should not pull out easily
   - Should be evenly seated (not twisted)

**If It Keeps Popping Out:**
- Channel may be too wide (bent/damaged)
- Rubber may be shrunk (old weatherstrip)
- Solution: Add adhesive per Option 2

### Repair Option 4: Complete Weatherstrip Replacement

**When to Use:**
- Weatherstrip is torn, cracked, or hardened
- Visible deterioration or dry rot
- Leaks persist after repair attempts

**Difficulty:** Moderate
**Time:** 1-2 hours

## Diagnosing Your Specific Issue

Based on "weatherstripping sometimes comes loose when the door opens," here's what's likely happening:

### Most Likely Causes (In Order of Probability)

#### 1. Broken Clips (Most Common)
**What's happening:**
- Plastic clips that hold weatherstrip have broken
- Clips become brittle with age and temperature cycles
- Freezing rain accelerates failure

**How to confirm:**
- Pull weatherstrip back gently where it's loose
- Look for broken white/black plastic clip pieces
- Check if weatherstrip has slots that should slide onto clips

**Fix:**
- Replace clips (Option 1 above)
- Cost: $8-15 for clip set
- Time: 30-60 minutes
- **No adhesive needed if clips are replaced**

#### 2. Press-Fit Seal Lost Tension (Second Most Common)
**What's happening:**
- Door-mounted weatherstrip has shrunk with age
- Rubber has lost elasticity
- No longer stays pressed into channel

**How to confirm:**
- Pull on weatherstrip - does it come out easily?
- Look for U-shaped channel in door frame
- Weatherstrip has bulb edge that fits into channel

**Fix:**
- Try press-fit reinstallation first (Option 3)
- If keeps popping out: add adhesive (Option 2)
- If rubber is cracked/hard: replace weatherstrip (Option 4)

#### 3. Adhesive Failed (Less Common in Original Installation)
**What's happening:**
- Previous owner added adhesive as a repair
- Adhesive has dried out and failed
- Common if car lived in hot climate

**How to confirm:**
- Look for sticky residue on door or weatherstrip
- Old adhesive may be crusty or crumbly

**Fix:**
- Remove old adhesive completely
- Apply new adhesive properly (Option 2)

### Questions to Narrow It Down

Answer these to determine your exact situation:

1. **Which door(s)?**
   - Driver, passenger, or both front doors?
   - Rear doors? (Different parts)

2. **Where on the door?**
   - Top corner near mirror?
   - Bottom near rocker panel?
   - Along the entire side?
   - Front edge near latch?

3. **Which weatherstrip?**
   - The seal attached to the door itself?
   - The seal attached to the body around the opening?
   - Both?

4. **Can you see clips or clip holes?**
   - Yes = clip-type (replace clips, no glue needed)
   - No = press-fit or adhesive type

5. **How bad is it?**
   - Pops out an inch and springs back?
   - Hangs completely loose?
   - Makes noise when driving?
   - Visible gaps causing water leaks?

---

## Preventive Maintenance

### Regular Inspection Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Visual check for gaps | Every 3 months | Catch failures early |
| Clean weatherstrip | Every 6 months | Remove dirt that causes wear |
| Lubricate with silicone | Annually | Maintain flexibility, prevent sticking |
| Check clips | Annually | Replace before they fail |

### Cleaning Procedure

**Do This:**
1. Wipe weatherstrip with damp cloth
2. Use mild soap and water for stubborn dirt
3. Dry thoroughly
4. Apply silicone spray (light coat)

**Don't Do This:**
- Don't use petroleum products (damages rubber)
- Don't use ArmorAll or tire shine (too slippery, degrades rubber)
- Don't use harsh chemicals or solvents
- Don't scrub with abrasive pads

### Silicone Lubricant Application

**Why:**
- Prevents rubber from drying out
- Reduces friction when closing door
- Helps shed water and ice
- Prevents freezing shut in winter

**How:**
1. Clean weatherstrip first (dirt will trap moisture)
2. Spray silicone onto rag (not directly on weatherstrip)
3. Wipe along entire length
4. Buff off excess (should not be dripping)
5. Close door and open - should move smoothly

**Recommended Products:**
- 3M Silicone Spray
- CRC Silicone Spray
- Permatex Silicone Spray
- Any 100% silicone lubricant

**Frequency:** 2-3 times per year
- Spring (after winter ice)
- Fall (before winter)
- Optional: Mid-summer if car sits in sun

### Winter Protection

**Problem:** Freezing rain causes weatherstrip to freeze to door opening

**Prevention:**
- Apply silicone lubricant before winter
- Crack windows slightly when parking (releases pressure)
- Don't slam frozen doors (breaks clips)

**If Frozen Shut:**
- DON'T force door open (will break clips/tear weatherstrip)
- Warm car with remote start
- Pour lukewarm (NOT hot) water along seal
- Use de-icer spray
- Gently work door open once ice melts

### Signs of Wear to Watch For

**Replace weatherstrip when you see:**
- Cracks or tears in rubber
- Hard, inflexible sections (dry rot)
- Permanent compression marks
- Crumbling or flaking
- Visible daylight through closed door
- Water leaks during car wash

**Normal aging (not urgent):**
- Slight discoloration
- Light surface oxidation
- Minor compression (still seals)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Weatherstrip Keeps Popping Out

**Possible Causes:**
1. Broken clips → Replace clips
2. Wrong weatherstrip installed → Verify part number
3. Door misaligned → Adjust door hinges
4. Channel damaged → May need body repair

**Solution Path:**
- Try clip replacement first (cheapest)
- If that fails, add adhesive
- If still fails, check door alignment

### Issue: Wind Noise After "Repair"

**Causes:**
- Weatherstrip not fully seated
- Installed backwards or upside down
- Gap at connection points
- Wrong weatherstrip for your model

**Fix:**
- Remove and reinstall carefully
- Check orientation (bulb faces inward)
- Ensure continuous seal with no gaps

### Issue: Door Hard to Close After Weatherstrip Work

**Causes:**
- Too much adhesive (causing bulk)
- Weatherstrip twisted or doubled over
- New weatherstrip not yet compressed
- Door striker needs adjustment

**Fix:**
- Check for bulges or misalignment
- Allow new weatherstrip to "break in" (1-2 weeks)
- Adjust striker if needed

### Issue: Water Leaks Despite New Weatherstrip

**Check:**
1. Is weatherstrip installed correctly (bulb facing right way)?
2. Are there gaps at corners or ends?
3. Is the door opening weatherstrip also failing?
4. Could water be entering elsewhere (sunroof drain, etc.)?

**Common Water Entry Points:**
- Door opening seal (body-mounted)
- Door seal (door-mounted)
- Window belt seal
- Rear of door at hinge area
- Body panel seams (not weatherstrip)

Test with hose to locate exact entry point.

### Issue: Weatherstrip Looks Wavy or Buckled

**Cause:**
- Adhesive applied while weatherstrip was stretched
- Weatherstrip too long for opening
- Temperature change caused expansion

**Fix:**
- Remove and reinstall without stretching
- May need to trim excess length
- Ensure weatherstrip is relaxed during installation

## Quick Answer for Your Specific Question

**"Does Subaru say to glue that or are the tabs supposed to be enough?"**

**Subaru's Factory Design:**
- Clipped sections: **Tabs alone are sufficient - no glue needed**
- Press-fit sections: **Press-fit alone is sufficient - no glue needed**
- Specific corners/ends: **Factory adhesive may be used**

**When to Add Adhesive (Per Subaru Service Procedures):**
- Replacing weatherstrip in areas that originally had adhesive
- Repairing weatherstrip where clips are broken and unavailable
- Supplementing press-fit installation that keeps failing

**Your Situation:**
If weatherstrip "sometimes comes loose when the door opens," you most likely have:

1. **Broken clips** (if it's the body-mounted seal)
   - **Solution:** Replace clips - $8-15, 30-60 min
   - **No adhesive needed**

2. **Lost press-fit tension** (if it's the door-mounted seal)
   - **Solution:** Try pressing it back in
   - **If keeps popping out:** Add adhesive

**Bottom Line:**
- Original design doesn't require glue in most locations
- Tabs/clips should be enough *if they're not broken*
- Adhesive is a valid repair option when clips fail
- Replacing broken clips is better than adding glue to broken clips
