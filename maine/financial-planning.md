| Federal Tax (est.) | ~$24,000 |
| NJ State Tax | ~$8,000 (6.37% marginal) |
| Jersey City Income Tax | ~$1,500 (1%) |

## Monthly Budget Projection

Based on $150K salary, $350K home, $100K down payment:

### Income
| Category | Monthly |
|----------|---------|
| Gross Income | $12,500 |
| Federal Tax | ($2,000) |
| Maine State Tax | ($775) |
| FICA | ($956) |
| **Net Income** | **$8,769** |

### Fixed Expenses
| Category | Monthly | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Mortgage (P&I) | $1,663 | 6.5% on $250K |
| Property Tax | $385 | Escrowed |
| Home Insurance | $125 | Escrowed |
| Internet (Fiber) | $80 | Fidium 1 Gbps |
| Utilities (avg) | $300 | Higher in winter |
| Car Insurance | $150 | |
| **Total Fixed** | **$2,703** | |

### Variable/Discretionary
| Category | Monthly |
|----------|---------|
| Groceries | $500 |
| Gas | $150 |
| Dining/Entertainment | $300 |
| Pet Expenses | $150 |
| Car Maintenance/Projects | $200 |
| Subscriptions | $100 |
| Misc | $200 |
| **Total Variable** | **$1,600** |

### Summary
| Category | Monthly |
|----------|---------|
| Net Income | $8,769 |
| Fixed Expenses | ($2,703) |
| Variable Expenses | ($1,600) |
| **Remaining** | **$4,466** |

**This leaves substantial room for:**
- Emergency fund building
- Retirement contributions (401k, IRA)
- Car project fund
- Savings for garage improvements
- Roommate rent contributions (pure upside)

## Roommate Considerations

Since neither roommate wants equity:

### Option 1: Formal Lease Agreements
- Draft lease agreements as landlord/tenant
- Set fair market rent (maybe slight discount)
- They pay monthly, you handle mortgage
- Clear expectations on utilities, pets, maintenance

### Option 2: Informal Contribution
- They contribute to shared expenses
- Less formal but potential for messiness
- Consider what happens if someone moves out

### Rent Contribution Estimate

| Fair Market | Your Discount | Their Contribution |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| $800-1000/room | 20% friend discount | $640-800/room |

**If both pay $700/mo:** That's $1,400/mo toward your $2,153 housing cost = you pay $753/mo for a $350K house.

### Legal Notes
- Get everything in writing
- Maine landlord-tenant law applies
- Consider LLC for liability protection (optional, adds complexity)

## Closing Cost Estimates

For a $350K purchase:

| Item | Estimate |
|------|----------|
| Loan Origination (1%) | $2,500 |
| Appraisal | $500 |
| Title Insurance | $1,500 |
| Attorney Fees | $800 |
| Recording Fees | $200 |
| Home Inspection | $400 |
| Survey (if needed) | $500 |
| Prepaid Taxes/Insurance | $2,000 |
| **Total** | **~$8,400** |

**With Advantage program:** $8,400 - $5,000 = ~$3,400 out of pocket for closing

---

2. [ ] Get pre-approved with MaineHousing-approved lender
